.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
samtools stats
.RI [ options ]
.IR in.sam | in.bam | in.cram
.RI [ region ...]

.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
samtools stats collects statistics from BAM files and outputs in a text format.
The output can be visualized graphically using plot-bamstats.

.SH OPTIONS
.TP 8
.BI "-c, --coverage " MIN , MAX , STEP
Set coverage distribution to the specified range (MIN, MAX, STEP all given as integers)
[1,1000,1]
.TP
.B -d, --remove-dups
Exclude from statistics reads marked as duplicates
.TP
.BI "-f, --required-flag "  STR "|" INT
Required flag, 0 for unset. See also `samtools flags`
[0]
.TP
.BI "-F, --filtering-flag " STR "|" INT
Filtering flag, 0 for unset. See also `samtools flags`
[0]
.TP
.BI "--GC-depth " FLOAT
the size of GC-depth bins (decreasing bin size increases memory requirement)
[2e4]
.TP
.B -h, --help
This help message
.TP
.BI "-i, --insert-size " INT
Maximum insert size
[8000]
.TP
.BI "-I, --id " STR
Include only listed read group or sample name
[]
.TP
.BI "-l, --read-length " INT
Include in the statistics only reads with the given read length
[-1]
.TP
.BI "-m, --most-inserts " FLOAT
Report only the main part of inserts
[0.99]
.TP
.BI "-P, --split-prefix " STR
A path or string prefix to prepend to filenames output when creating
categorised statistics files with
.BR -S / --split .
[input filename]
.TP
.BI "-q, --trim-quality " INT
The BWA trimming parameter
[0]
.TP
.BI "-r, --ref-seq " FILE
Reference sequence (required for GC-depth and mismatches-per-cycle calculation).
[]
.TP
.BI "-S, --split " TAG
In addition to the complete statistics, also output categorised statistics
based on the tagged field
.I TAG
(e.g., use
.B --split RG
to split into read groups).

Categorised statistics are written to files named
.RI < prefix >_< value >.bamstat,
where
.I prefix
is as given by
.B --split-prefix
(or the input filename by default) and
.I value
has been encountered as the specified tagged field's value in one or more
alignment records.
.TP
.BI "-t, --target-regions " FILE
Do stats in these regions only. Tab-delimited file chr,from,to, 1-based, inclusive.
[]
.TP
.B "-x, --sparse"
Suppress outputting IS rows where there are no insertions.
.TP
.B "-p, --remove-overlaps"
Remove overlaps of paired-end reads from coverage and base count computations.
.TP
.BI "-g, --cov-threshold " INT
Only bases with coverage above this value will be included in the target percentage computation [0]
